# ce2001_ex4_graphs

Benchmarking setup for BFS in a undirected, unweighted graph.

This implementation makes use of Google's guava Java library in order to
perform result validation and analysis.

Implemented in order to tackle requirements for Example class 4 in NTU's 
CE2002 course (AY19/20 Semester 1).

Gradle is used to manage the build.

## What's working

- Basically, _nothing_. This is just a skeleton.
  
## Building the benchmark tool

### Clone from git

```
git clone https://github.com/shenghaoyang/ce2001_ex4_graphs.git
cd ce2001_ex4_graphs
./gradlew build
./gradlew run # Does nothing at this stage, it's an empty wrapper.
```

After cloning, you can also import the project into your favorite IDE,
most of which should support Gradle.

## Benchmark results

To be done.
